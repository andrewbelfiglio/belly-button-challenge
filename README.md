# belly-button-challenge

### This project is an assignment in the Data Science and Data Visualizations bootcamp at the University of Pennsylvania in collaboration with edX.

### This repository contains an index.html file to display a dashboard in a web browser. The app.js file in the static folder uses javascript to create the visualizations and add them to the html. The samples.json file is a local copy of the data being displayed, though the code itself will retrieve the data from a URL endpoint.

### The data being displayed is microbial species found in belly buttons amongst 153 test subjects.

### This code is original and is based on the curriculum of the bootcamp program, except where credit is noted in the comments of the app.js file.
